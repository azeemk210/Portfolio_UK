        <h1>ILMIS: Integrated Land Management Information System </h1>
        <p> Watershed delineation is a fundamental process in the field of hydrology and environmental science. It involves the identification of the boundaries of a watershed, which is an area of land where all the surface water drains into a common outlet, such as a river, stream, or lake. In addition to delineating watershed boundaries, hydrologists often classify the streams within a watershed into different orders based on their size and position within the drainage network</p>

        <h1>Site Suitability for Mulberry Plantation</h1>
        <p>Site suitability analysis is a crucial step in the successful cultivation of mulberry plants.  This analysis integrates key data layers, including soil types, slope characteristics, land use and land cover (LULC) information, and groundwater availability. By combining these datasets in QGIS, we create a comprehensive site suitability map, highlighting the most favorable locations for mulberry cultivation.</p>

        <h1>Satellite Image Classification - Supervised</h1>
        <p> Image classification is a fundamental technique in remote sensing. One of the primary applications of image classification is to analyze land cover and land use patterns over large areas. We classified a satellite image into five distinct classes: Agriculture, Water, Sand, Built-Up, and Forest. Image classification is a crucial step in the analysis of remote sensing data, enabling the extraction of meaningful information from satellite images</p>

        <h1>Oil Spill Detection</h1>
        <p>Sentinel-1 is equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. These radar images are exceptionally valuable for oil spill detection as they are unaffected by weather conditions, and they can detect oil even in the absence of visible light. Oil spills on water surfaces often cause changes in radar backscatter values in Sentinel-1 imagery. To extract regions with significant changes, a threshold is applied. Pixels with backscatter values above this threshold are considered potential oil spill. </p>

        <p>This project leverages Google Earth Engine to access Sentinel-5P satellite imagery, focusing on India, and isolates the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a specific time frame. By calculating the mean NO2 column density within a defined area, it effectively demonstrates how environmental monitoring tools can be harnessed for assessing air quality. With a visually compelling map that employs a color palette to represent NO2 concentration levels, this exemplifies a valuable application in tracking and addressing air quality concerns.</p>
